## About Me

I am a final-year Ph.D. student from the school of cyber science and engineering, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), where I specialize in audio signal analysis and multimodal learning. My academic journey began at Wuhan University, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in 2020 with a thesis on spoofed speech detection. My research focuses primarily on audio event detection and multimodal learning. Currently, I'm focusing on audio-visual event localization on portrait mode short videos while keeping a keen eye on advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). 

When not immersed in research works, I recharge by strumming my guitar or diving into Dota 2. Check out [this page](/others) if youâ€™d like to know the human behind the research.

For collaboration or discussion about audio AI, LLM, multimodal systems, or the occasional off-topic thought, feel free to reach out.

## Research Interests

My research begins with audio signal processing and spans to multimodal learning. Currently, I'm focusing on: 

- Audio-visual event localization on portrait mode short videos.
- Audio understanding, especially audio event detection.
- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

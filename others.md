## Beyond work

A few identities I wear outside the lab: post-rock devotee, mediocre guitarist, and Dota 2 veteran.

I’m a rock enthusiast and once co-founded a post-rock band called Numb Lamb (呆住的羊). You can still find our gigs on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1AN4y137Zv). Though we disbanded in 2022, those folks remain my closest friends (~~*for tolerating my amateur strumming*~~).

I also adore theater. As a co-founder of WHUsical, a student-run musical society in Wuhan University, I stage-managed full-length productions of Les Misérables (2018) and Phantom of the Opera (2017). At my peak, I could recite Les Mis’s entire script backward—every line, every prop placement, every lighting cue. Those grassroots productions, fueled purely by student passion, are among my fondest memories.

Dota 2 is my eternal game. Since my first match in 2010, I’ve logged 15 years (and counting) in its trenches. My personal best record is hitting Immortal rank in 2024 (top 1% in China, ranked ~4k). I also love soulslikes (Dark Souls, Elden Ring) and DND-inspired RPGs (BG3), with a soft spot for indie gems.

I enjoy literature and films since I was a kid. I recently rewatched [The Newsroom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1870479/) —its idealism still gives me chills.

Back when the internet was *open*, I volunteered with the [Global Translator Community (GTC)](https://www.coursera.support/s/gtc-page), subtitling Coursera courses and The Daily Show (Jon Stewart era) for Chinese audiences.

I’ve spent years chasing passions beyond the "correct" path. Sometimes, under peer pressure, I wonder if I’ve "wasted" too much time—but these experiences define me more than any line on my CV. Amid career pursuits, I've never stopped guarding my idealism and romance, resisting the pull of cynicism. If you’re reading this, I hope you’ve kept that flame alive too.
